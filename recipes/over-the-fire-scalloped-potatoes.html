    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I make these great hands on potatoes beforehand, when everything is going to be cooked on the grill. 
        They're also great for a campfire on a small grill. 
        These potatoes will keep everyone coming back for more! Have recipe in hand!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large baking potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
        <li>1&frasl;2 cup crumbled crisply cooked bacon (Optional)</li>
        <li>1&frasl;2 cup sauteed mushrooms (Optional)</li>
        <li>1&frasl;2 cup butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <p>Preheat a grill for medium heat.</p>

                Prepare 8 pieces of aluminum foil with vegetable cooking spray. 
                Combine potatoes, green onion, soup, cheese, (and bacon and mushrooms if using) in a bowl. 
                Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
                Evenly divide the potato mixture among the squares of aluminum foil.
                Dot with butter. Fold into foil packets, sealing well.

                Cook foil packets on the grill for 12 to 20 minutes, until the potatoes have cooked.
